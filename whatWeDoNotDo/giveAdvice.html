                Give advice on how to make somebody adhere to a treatment they do not want or how to

            For the perspective of those who oppose forced treatment - the position shared by the FAMHR - see,
            for example, the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/MentalHealth/A_HRC_39_36_EN.pdf">United Nations Human Rights Council</a>, and the <a href="https://www.bazelon.org/our-work/mental-health-systems/forced-treatment/">Bazelon Center for Mental Health
            Law</a> (which makes an exception for “rare circumstances”). For the perspective of those who support
            forced treatment, see, for example <a href="https://helplinefaqs.nami.org/article/39-what-are-my-options-for-caring-for-a-loved-one-who-wont-get-treatment-can-i-have-them-involuntarily-committed">NAMI</a> and <a href="https://www.tac.org/">Treatment Advocacy Center</a> (TAC).
