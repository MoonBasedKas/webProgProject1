                “Mental illness” and “mental disorder” are controversial terms. Some people embrace them; some think
that they are not valid concepts; some find them stigmatizing. Some embrace the term “madness” and
describe themselves as “mad” rather than “mentally ill”; some apply the broad term “psychosocial
disability” to what others would describe as “madness,” “mental illness,” or “extreme state.” Among
those who reject the concept of “mental illness/disorder,” some accept terms like “psychosis,”
“delusions,” “hallucinations”; others use different words and expressions for the states conventionally
described by these terms.<br><br>
We follow the SAMHSA Guide to Equity Terminology: “Acknowledge and respect how people choose
to define and identify themselves.” In our conversations, everyone is free to use the language of their
choice without any censure. For example, in our personal stories, one author may talk about
“psychosis,” another about “an extreme state,” or about “hearing voices and seeing visions.” To
describe your own experience on this website, feel free to use any terms you are comfortable with.<br><br>
For the perspective of those embracing the term “mental illness,” see, for example, National Alliance
on Mental Illness (NAMI) and Mental Illness Policy. For the perspective of those rejecting the term
“mental illness” and using different language, see, for example, ISEPP and MindFreedom.<br><br>
For a better understanding of how different ways to describe one’s psychological suffering affects the
individual, see the story of Rose Cartwright who used to be “the poster girl for obsessive-compulsive
disorder.”<br><br>
