                “Mental illness” and “mental disorder” are controversial terms. <a href="https://mhe-sme.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/A-short-guide-to-Psychiatric-Diagnosis-FINAL.pdf">Some people embrace them; some think
                that they are not valid concepts; some find them stigmatizing.</a> Some embrace the term “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6420721/">madness</a>” and
                describe themselves as “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beyond-mental-health/202312/mad-pride-and-neurodiversity">mad</a>” rather than “mentally ill”; some apply the broad term “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/mental-health-legal-capacity-and-human-rights/in-the-pursuit-of-justice-advocacy-by-and-for-hypermarginalized-people-with-psychosocial-disabilities-through-the-law-and-beyond/183386FB8AD507013D9B1DF4DD30C725">psychosocial
                disability</a>” to what others would describe as “madness,” “mental illness,” or “extreme state.” Among
                those who reject the concept of “mental illness/disorder,” some accept terms like “psychosis,”
                “delusions,” “hallucinations”; others use different words and expressions for the states conventionally
                described by these terms.<br><br>

                “mental illness” and using different language, see, for example, <a href="https://psychintegrity.org/">ISEPP</a> and <a href="https://mindfreedom.org/kb/voices-for-choices/voices-for-choices-what-is-mental-illness/">MindFreedom</a>.<br><br>
