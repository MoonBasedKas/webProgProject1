                We neither encourage, nor discourage anyone to take, discontinue, or switch prescribed medications.
                Please discuss your choice concerning all medications with a trusted licensed medical provider. We
                offer an accessible digest of facts about commonly used medications, based on the official FDA
                documents and peer-reviewed medical publications. We also share our personal experiences, but we do
                not discuss anyone else's individual choices.<br><br>
                Looking back at the time when our loved ones were first prescribed psychotropic medication, many of
                us feel that this happened without true <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000445.htm">informed</a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430827/"> consent</a>, which requires a full explanation of the
                treatment's risks and benefits to adults and to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK555889/">parents/guardians of minors</a>. We did not always receive
                such an explanation from doctors, nor could we easily find it on our own. We seek to correct what we
                perceive as an informational imbalance: facts about risks, side effects, and adverse events associated
                with medications are difficult to find, while information about the positive aspects of medications is
                widely available.<br><br>
                We do our utmost to ensure that all our statements are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470182/">evidence-based</a>. We invite all the website
                visitors, and especially health professionals and researchers, to send us their corrections if they see
                mistakes, inaccuracies, or use of non-valid sources. If you contact us about corrections, please provide
                an explanation and cite relevant studies.
