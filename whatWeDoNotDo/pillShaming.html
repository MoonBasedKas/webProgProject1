    <h3>Pill Shaming</h3>
    <p>
        We neither encourage, nor discourage anyone to take, discontinue, or switch prescribed medications.
Please discuss your choice concerning all medications with a trusted licensed medical provider. We
offer an accessible digest of facts about commonly used medications, based on the official FDA
documents and peer-reviewed medical publications. We also share our personal experiences, but we do
not discuss anyone else’s individual choices.<br>
Looking back at the time when our loved ones were first prescribed psychotropic medication, many of
us feel that this happened without true informed consent, which requires a full explanation of the
treatment’s risks and benefits to adults and to parents/guardians of minors. We did not always receive
such an explanation from doctors, nor could we easily find it on our own. We seek to correct what we
perceive as an informational imbalance: facts about risks, side effects, and adverse events associated
with medications are difficult to find, while information about the positive aspects of medications is
widely available.<br>
We do our utmost to ensure that all our statements are evidence-based. We invite all the website
visitors, and especially health professionals and researchers, to send us their corrections if they see
mistakes, inaccuracies, or use of non-valid sources. If you contact us about corrections, please provide
an explanation and cite relevant studies.
