            For the perspective of those interpreting voices, visions, and other unusual experiences in spiritual
            terms, as a connection to the transcendent domain, see, for example, <a href="http://www.centerforspiritualemergence.com/">The Center for Spiritual
            Emergence</a> and the memoir <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Beautiful-Psychosis-Making-Madness/dp/1912807955">My Beautiful Psychosis</a>. For the perspective of those interpreting unusual
            experiences and behaviors, such as “performing excessive religious rituals,” as symptoms of mental
            illness, see, for example, “<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/religious-delusions">Religious Delusions</a>” in Medical News Today. For a clinician's take on this
            subject, see Ron Unger, <a href="https://recoveryfrompsychosis.org/2024/09/working-effectively-with-the-intersection-of-psychosis-and-spirituality/">Working Effectively with the Intersection of Psychosis and Spirituality</a>.
