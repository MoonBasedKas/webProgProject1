                We don't promote spiritual interpretations of experiences commonly described as “psychosis”
            </h1>
            For the perspective of those interpreting voices, visions, and other unusual experiences in spiritual
            terms, as a connection to the transcendent domain, see, for example, The Center for Spiritual
            Emergence and the memoir My Beautiful Psychosis. For the perspective of those interpreting unusual
            experiences and behaviors, such as “performing excessive religious rituals,” as symptoms of mental
            illness, see, for example, “Religious Delusions” in Medical News Today. For a clinician's take on this
            subject, see Ron Unger, Working Effectively with the Intersection of Psychosis and Spirituality.
