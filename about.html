                    The <span style="color: blue;">Family Alliance for Mental Health Recovery</span> (FAMHR) was founded by a group of parents whose
                    children were diagnosed with serious mental illness (SMI) or with psychosis. It includes people who
                    have been diagnosed with SMI or psychosis, their family members and friends, and allies. See our
