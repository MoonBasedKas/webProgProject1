                            A psychiatric <a href="./diagnosis.html">diagnosis</a> does NOT mean changing one's life plans, abandoning one's dreams, inability
                            to have family, and living as a chronically ill or disabled person. Recovery happens more often than
                            most people realize. Family support plays a key role.

                            As one parent to another, <a href="https://rethinkpsychosis.weebly.com/uploads/1/1/0/1/110120995/lowerresoutsidetheboxv1.pdf">if your loved one perceives reality in a very unusual way - hears voices that other people don't hear,
                            sees things that others don't see, and/or has other uncommon experiences</a> - this is conventionally called
                            psychosis or “psychotic episode.” When your kid starts talking with invisible aliens, or claims that the CIA implanted a
                            device in their brain, it can be scary for you, but try not to panic. Remember that voices, visions and unusual beliefs and
                            perceptions do not, in themselves, make somebody more violent than the average person. Stay calm and compassionate, find
                            the right kind of help that your child will be willing to accept, and this episode most likely will end with no lasting damage.
                            You and your child may even learn something important from this experience.<br><br>
                            If your loved one receives a <a href="./diagnosis.html">diagnosis</a> of serious mental illness, such as “schizophrenia,” “bipolar
                            disorder,” “major depression,” or “obsessive compulsive disorder,” provide them with support and advocacy in their journey
                            to recovery. Many people with such diagnoses live a “normal” life - receive professional degrees, have careers and families
                            (and no, their children have no special risk of getting some “terrible disease” or “bad genes”). We hear little about good
                            outcomes for people diagnosed with SMI, because most of them stay silent about their experiences, fearing stigma and
                            discrimination. Read inspiring stories of successful people with SMI diagnoses who courageously came
                            out of the closet.
