        <h1>Cat Master</h1>
        <p>
            One day I had a cat. Then the cat attacked ruining my newly purchased curtains. It was awful, 
            and I couldn't believe Mr. Pickles would do such a thing. Many of my visitors told me that Mr.
            Pickles was evil, but I didn't believe them after all why would an orange cat be evil. It 
            just didn't make sense like he's a cat what evil is there? However, I asked the cat, and he said 
            "well yes I am quite evil, and it only took you five years to notice. It's all 
            because you gave me that cursed name Mr. Pickles." Weird times...

        <h1>Bread Panic</h1>
        <p>
            I ran out of bread yesterday. It was the morning I was too tired to realize the severity of 
            my circumstances. I just said "It's okay I'll get bread at the store later today". I kept 
            going about my day as per usual, but then I realized how will I have grilled cheese for lunch 
            without any bread. Panic set in, the world turned blue, and the hostilities began. I rushed 
            out of work while my boss tried giving me this pink paper. Not sure what that was about. When 
            I got to the supermarket the bread was gone. So I went to the next and kept searching. Alas, 
            no bread could be found. So I went to my boss's house breaking in taking this baguette I saw on 
            the counter. It was so fresh, so beautiful... Let's just say I had an amazing grilled cheese 
            after that.
