                Diagnostic process for physical illness is based on medical symptoms and medical signs (biomarkers):<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interview is, by definition, a conversation: the doctor asks questions and hears about symptoms
                        perceived by the patient.</li>
                    <li>Physical exam is “the process of evaluating objective anatomic findings through the use of
                        observation, palpation, percussion, and auscultation.” It requires instruments, such as
                        thermometer to take temperature, or stethoscope to hear better internal body sounds.</li>
                    <li>Diagnostic testing is a lab analysis of bodily fluids or tissues and imaging, such as X-ray,
                        ultrasound, or MRI performed by specially trained medical technologists using special
                        equipment.
                    </li>

                Steps 2 and 3 are used to find biomarkers of a specific disease. These are “medical signs- that is,
objective indications of medical state observed from outside the patient - which can be measured
accurately and reproducibly. Medical signs stand in contrast to medical symptoms, which are limited to
those indications of health or illness perceived by patients themselves.”
For example, during the interview, the patient tells the doctor about cough and fever. During the
physical exam, the doctor takes temperature and listens to the patient's lungs. During the diagnostic
testing, the patient's nasal fluid is examined in a lab and a chest X-ray is performed in another lab. A
presence of a specific virus in the nasal fluid, or white spots on the X-ray image can be biomarkers of
Covid or pneumonia.

                Diagnostic process for mental illness is based on symptoms only:
                <ul>
                    <li>During the interview, the doctor hears about symptoms perceived by the patient and by people
                        who know the patient, such as family, roommates, or colleagues.</li>
                    <li>During the physical exam, the doctor observes patient's behavior without any special
                        instruments. Additionally, the patient may be hospitalized for 72 hours and observed by hospital
                        staff members, who do not use any special instruments. They describe the patient's behavior,
                        and the doctor uses these descriptions when making a diagnosis.</li>
                    <li>During the diagnostic testing, the doctor uses screening tools that are scripted interviews: a list
                        of questions for the patient and people who know him. The diagnosis depends on their answers.
